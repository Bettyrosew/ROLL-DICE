## Description
It is an online game which consists of two players ,playing against each other, who roll a dice one at a time. The number the player rolls on is added to the points he/she has acquired.Unfortunately, if one rolls on number 1 their opponent is given a chance to play and they don't get any points.Alternatively, one can click the hold button to give the opponent a chance to play in case he/she is satisfied with his/her current points.However, the winner of the game is the person who arrives at 100 points first.
